<h1 class="nhsuk-heading-l" id="case-name">Navigating the prototype and context notes)</h1>
<p class="nhsuk-body">Start here! See this excel file <a href="https://nhs-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/vinodkumar_narayanan1_nhs_net/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx">https://nhs-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/vinodkumar_narayanan1_nhs_net/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx</a> for UX user stories + associated links. It's probably easiest to read through that first.<br>
Below is a collection of the pages developed as part of the prototype. Some are 'sketches', some are more resolved flows.</p>

<h2>General walkthrough notes about the prototype + iterations post testing</h2>

<p class="nhsuk-body">We did one round of user testing + a set of user research interviews. After the first iteration of the prototype we got to see the current system (slightly eccentric sequencing, I realise - it requires a CIS account HOWEVER you can see a fairly accurate wireframe here, this is very useful to get an overview of the current system) and made changes accordingly. 

The main changes are going 'into' a set of endpoints via the organisation and its ODS code rather than via a named product. I also updated the granular view of what an endpoint looks like to make it more accurately follow the existing system (initial one <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/end-point-details1">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/end-point-details1</a>  vs updated one <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/newer/cma-profile">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/newer/cma-profile</a> ). We also removed the 'start page' <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/start-page">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/start-page</a> as it was unnecessary and didn't map to what users needed + their differing circumstances + added a more action based landing page <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home</a>. The intention is the service is accessed via developer account, as per something like this <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/index">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/index</a> . User testing suggested we would benefit from a nav bar throughout, as per <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home</a> . This has the benefit of being similar to the current service. Further testing could show that simple breadcrumbs may be adequate without top nav bar. 
</p>

<p class="nhsuk-body">Older version of entry page, discarded as uses old version of dev account landing
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/index--older">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/index--older</a>

Landing page or 'way in' via dev account logged in
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/index">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/index</a> 
<br>
Second iteration of landing page with more action oriented headings. 
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home</a> 
<br>
Early iteration of landing page as per legacy dev account patterns, since discarded for <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com//home">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com//home</a>
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/dhlanding3">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/dhlanding3</a> 
<br>

How to begin adding an endpoint. Testing showed users mental model was 'find an organisation' then find product then find endpoint. Start off with some sort of Autocomplete with ODS code. This mockup is a compromise 
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/find">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/find</a> 
<br>
See also <a href="https://epr-govstyle-d9a515282386.herokuapp.com/auto2">https://epr-govstyle-d9a515282386.herokuapp.com/auto2</a> using this pattern <a href="https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/autocomplete/">https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/autocomplete/</a> which is better.
<br>
Then selecting an organisation would take the user to 
<br>
View showing organisation, with tab of products open. This is how you would navigate to the end point. Via Org -> Product -> endpoint 
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/auto2">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/auto2</a>

<br>Later version of this which is better reflective of current system AND shows message set details

<br>Flow of adding endpoint details
<br>First version followed 'one thing per page'.

<br>Didn't test well so went with all things on one page. 
<br>
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/question-page-mhs-one-page">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/question-page-mhs-one-page</a> 
<br>
Check your answers after submitting details. N.b ability to 'change' / modify answers may be role dependent. 
<br>
<br><a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/check-your-answers-mhs">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/check-your-answers-mhs</a>

<br>
Confirmation page. The service design / further actions for this need to be validated. <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/confirmation-page-mhs">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/confirmation-page-mhs</a> 
<br>
Later iteration showing endpoint details, this one seems better <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/modify-endpoint-success">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/modify-endpoint-success</a> see point around service design / further actions also applies here. 
<br>

Experiments using MOJ patterns for filters to deal with large numbers of producers. Superusers have to deal with high volumes so an effective search is important

<br>Various sketches/experiments with different patterns from MOJ / DfE design systems to deal with large amounts of data. Doesn't fully work within prototype kit, discarded. 

<br><a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/my-product2">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/my-product2</a>

<br>Dealing with 'teams' or organisations. Could be relevant or useful. Some preliminary work, not fully developed. Borrow from digital onboarding service designs. Needs further validation. 
<br><a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/org-page">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/org-page</a>

<br>Page showing organisation (+its associated products)
<br><a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/organisation">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/organisation</a> 
<br>Another iteration which <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/auto2">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/auto2</a> uses tabs. But missing action navigation to add an endpoint - forces user to do so via clicking into a specific product, this is intentional. However arguably it should have an 'Add a product' button.

<br>Different early sketches of what product page could look like
<br><a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions-old">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions-old</a>

<br><a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions2">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions2</a>

Actions on top of product list? Glitchy, discarded, over the top.

Initial version of list of products associated with a user, since replaced with user having to navigate via ODS code to find organisation THEN could see a page like this. Perhaps with filters, similar to DOS assessment tracker 
<a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-list">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-list</a> 

Start page, discarded, see above <a href="https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/start-page">https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/start-page</a>

These pages are an attempt to 'lift and shift' the current system, to transpose into NHS design system while roughly keeping the hierarchy + information used in current system. They need further iteration. Use with caution!

Confirmation of deletion. This is adapted from current system. I think it works pretty well. See also current DOS flow/pattern for confining deletion (the pages prior to seeing this)

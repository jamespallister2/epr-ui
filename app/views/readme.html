<h2>Navigating the prototype</h2><p class="nhsuk-body">
Start here! See this excel file https://nhs-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/vinodkumar_narayanan1_nhs_net/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx for UX user stories + associated links. It’s probably easiest to read through that first.<br>
Below is a collection of the pages developed as part of the prototype. Some are ‘sketches’, some are more resolved flows.</p>
<p>General scope of project here, see also links to UR https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=996823491&draftShareId=270f7781-c446-48b0-a37f-c836a9f10e42&. </p><br>

<h2>General walkthrough notes about the prototype + iterations post testing</h2>

<p class="nhsuk-body">We did one round of user testing + a set of user research interviews. After the first iteration of the prototype we got to see the current system (slightly eccentric sequencing, I realise - it requires a CIS account HOWEVER you can see a fairly accurate wireframe here, this is very useful to get an overview of the current system) and made changes accordingly. 

The main changes are going ‘into’ a set of endpoints via the organisation and its ODS code rather than via a named product. I also updated the granular view of what an endpoint looks like to make it more accurately follow the existing system (initial one https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/end-point-details1  vs updated one https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/newer/cma-profile ). We also removed the ’start page’ https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/start-page as it was unnecessary and didn’t map to what users needed + their differing circumstances + added a more action based landing page https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home. The intention is the service is accessed via developer account, as per something like this https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/index . User testing suggested we would benefit from a nav bar throughout, as per https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home . This has the benefit of being similar to the current service. Further testing could show that simple breadcrumbs may be adequate without top nav bar. 


Older version of entry page, discarded as uses old version of dev account landing<br>

Early iteration of landing page as per legacy dev account patterns, since discarded for https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/home <br>

How to begin adding an endpoint. Testing showed users mental model was ‘find an organisation’ then find product then find endpoint. <br>
Start off with some sort of Autocomplete with ODS code. This mockup is a compromise <br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/find <br>

See also https://epr-govstyle-d9a515282386.herokuapp.com/auto2 using this pattern https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/autocomplete/ which is better.<br>

Then selecting an organisation would take the user to <br>

View showing organisation, with tab of products open. This is how you would navigate to the end point. Via Org -> Product -> endpoint <br>

Beginning of  ‘create an endpoint’ <br>

Mockup of how endpoint details could look - without full access rights (so can’t modify)<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/end-point-details2 <br>
Later version of this which is better reflective of current system AND shows message set details<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/newer/cma-profile <br>

Flow of adding endpoint details<br>
First version followed ‘one thing per page’. 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/question-page-mhs-01 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/question-page-mhs-02

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/question-page-mhs-08 <br>

Didn’t test well so went with all things on one page. <br>

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/question-page-mhs-one-page 

Check your answers after submitting details. N.b ability to ‘change’ / modify answers may be role dependent. <br>

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/check-your-answers-mhs 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/check-your-answers 

Confirmation page. The service design / further actions for this need to be validated. https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/confirmation-page-mhs <br>

Later iteration showing endpoint details, <br>
this one seems better https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/modify-endpoint-success see point around service design / further actions also applies here. <br>


Experiments using MOJ patterns for filters to deal with large numbers of producers. Superusers have to deal with high volumes so an effective search is important<br>

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/content-page2 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/content-page3 

Various sketches/experiments with different patterns from MOJ / DfE design systems to deal with large amounts of data. Doesn’t fully work within prototype kit, discarded. <br>

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/my-products 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/myapps 

Dealing with ‘teams’ or organisations. Could be relevant or useful. Some preliminary work, not fully developed. Borrow from digital onboarding service designs. Needs further validation. <br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/org-page 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/org 
See also https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/team 

Page showing organisation (+its associated products)<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/organisation 
Another iteration which https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/auto2 uses tabs. But missing action navigation to add an endpoint - forces user to do so via clicking into a specific product, this is intentional. However arguably it should have an ‘Add a product’ button.<br>

Different early sketches of what product page could look like<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions-old 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions1

Actions on top
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions4-flip 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-actions4 

Actions on top of product list? Glitchy, discarded, over the top.<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-list-2 

Initial version of list of products associated with a user, since replaced with user having to navigate via ODS code to find organisation THEN could see a page like this. Perhaps with filters, similar to DOS assessment tracker <br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/product-list 

Start page, discarded, see above https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/start-page<br>

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/team <br>

These pages are an attempt to ‘lift and shift’ the current system, to transpose into NHS design system while roughly keeping the hierarchy + information used in current system. They need further iteration. Use with caution!<br>

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/new/as_editpage 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/new/as-view 
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/new/cma-profile 

Confirmation of deletion. This is adapted from current system. I think it works pretty well. See also current DOS flow/pattern for confining deletion (the pages prior to seeing this)<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/new/delete_cma_endpoint_success

https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/new/delete-mhs-endpoint 

View of MHS details<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/new/mhs-profile 

Select org, again would ideally work with autocomplete using ODS codes<br>
https://nhs-epr-ui-13cb23fc87a1.herokuapp.com/new/modify-endpoint-selectorg 

A version of modifying flow based on current model, I think there’s too much complexity on page and could benefit from breaking down into sub-steps.
